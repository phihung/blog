Hey, I’m Phi – a developer, AI engineer, and founder with a passion for building cool stuff.

I mostly write about things I enjoy, like AI, Python, Rust, and Math. You might see me dive into other tech topics too as I explore new things. It’s all pretty laid-back, and I’m just sharing what I find interesting or useful.

If any of this helps you out, awesome! Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat – I’d love to connect.
